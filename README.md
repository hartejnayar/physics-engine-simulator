#  Physics Engine Simulator
---
Built from scratch with `p5.js`, this is a full-fledged, modular physics simulation platform that brings key concepts of high school and early university physics to life — interactively, visually, and intuitively. From projectile motion to the Carnot cycle, every simulation is designed to make physics feel tangible and hands-on.

This was a passion project for me — not just to visualize physics, but to *understand it deeper*, debug how nature behaves, and design a tool that others could use to learn actively instead of just reading theory. The system is scalable, cleanly structured, and built with extensibility in mind.

##  What It Does

- Choose from a categorized dropdown of simulations across **Mechanics**, **Waves**, **Optics**, **Electricity**, **Electrostatics**, **Thermodynamics**, and **Modern Physics**
- Adjust real-time sliders (velocity, force, charge, radius, etc.) to watch how systems evolve
- View calculated outputs like time of flight, range, centripetal force, and capacitor voltage
- Objectives displayed below each simulation to contextualize the concept
- Designed entirely using vanilla JS and p5.js — no frameworks, no dependencies

## Project Highlights
---

### Modular Physics Engine Architecture
The simulator is built on a modular architecture, with each physics topic organized into its own script under a structured folder system. Core functionality is abstracted into shared logic files such as engine.js (for physics computations) and ui.js (for dynamic interface elements), ensuring clean separation of concerns and ease of scalability.

### Comprehensive Physics Coverage
The project includes over 30 simulations across key domains: Mechanics, Waves, Optics, Electricity, Electrostatics, Thermodynamics, and Modern Physics. Simulations such as projectile motion, SHM, diffraction, nuclear decay, and the Carnot cycle are all implemented with real-time interactivity and physical accuracy.

### Dynamic and Educational User Interface
The user interface features a responsive dropdown or sidebar menu and parameterized sliders for each simulation. Each module also includes learning objectives rendered directly onto the canvas to contextualize the concept being explored.

### High-Quality Canvas Visualizations
All simulations use p5.js to render animations on an HTML5 canvas. The visuals maintain conceptual clarity while remaining computationally lightweight, offering an engaging experience without visual clutter.

### Fully Deployed Web App
The simulator is deployed using GitHub Pages and can optionally be mapped to a custom domain. The project requires no external frameworks or libraries beyond p5.js, making it fast, portable, and open for further development.
