#  Physics Engine Simulator
---
Built from scratch with `p5.js`, this is a full-fledged, modular physics simulation platform that brings key concepts of high school and early university physics to life â€” interactively, visually, and intuitively. From projectile motion to the Carnot cycle, every simulation is designed to make physics feel tangible and hands-on.

This was a passion project for me â€” not just to visualize physics, but to *understand it deeper*, debug how nature behaves, and design a tool that others could use to learn actively instead of just reading theory. The system is scalable, cleanly structured, and built with extensibility in mind.

##  What It Does

- Choose from a categorized dropdown of simulations across **Mechanics**, **Waves**, **Optics**, **Electricity**, **Electrostatics**, **Thermodynamics**, and **Modern Physics**
- Adjust real-time sliders (velocity, force, charge, radius, etc.) to watch how systems evolve
- View calculated outputs like time of flight, range, centripetal force, and capacitor voltage
- Objectives displayed below each simulation to contextualize the concept
- Designed entirely using vanilla JS and p5.js â€” no frameworks, no dependencies
